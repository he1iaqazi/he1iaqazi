## 🌿 About Me
With a strong background in **Computer Engineering**, I am on a journey to become a **Front-End Developer** who builds bridges between structured logic and the art of creative design 🌉✨

Currently, I am deeply focused on mastering the modern web ecosystem, including **JavaScript (ES6+), React, and Tailwind CSS**, alongside the solid foundations of HTML and CSS. My goal is to build user interfaces that are not only beautiful and responsive but also intelligent and intuitive 🎯

My ultimate vision is to step into the fascinating world of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and merge it with user experience design. I aspire to create products that don’t just respond to user needs but anticipate them 💻🖱️

I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and exchange ideas with professionals in the fields of web development and artificial intelligence 🤝
